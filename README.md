Submission #2 - Changes

- Validated the HTML, no errors / warnings show (at least on my end).
- Images assigned to emails should now display in rows of 2 EXCEPT mobile screen sizes (320px - 767px), in which case all images are collected in one column.
- Split the "email-displayer" div into two sections: "email-displayer" and "email-image-displayer". This means they are their own separate boxes.
- Reduced h3 tag size on small screen sizes.
- Aligned h2 and h3 tags to center (except the "Select an email address" text, this aligns left on screen sizes other than mobile).
- Aligned "Add Email" and "Add Current Image" button to center on mobile, and left on screen sizes bigger than mobile.
- Various paddings / margins added for more space between elements.


Submission #3 - Changes

- Removed the Meerkat image and the functionality behind it (goodbye old friend).
